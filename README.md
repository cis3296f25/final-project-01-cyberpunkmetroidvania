# 21XX - A Cyperpunk MetroidVania


_"You wake up on a cold, hard, metallic floor. You don’t know where you are or what that weird sensation in your arm is. The last thing you remember is walking outside to check the hovermail and then - darkness. There’s only one thing you can do. You get up on your feet ready to face the harsh cybernetic reality you live in. This is the year 21XX."_

This project is a video game application that implements different pieces of inspiration from specific games. It is a Metroidvania, a 2-d platforming game that has the user collect new power-ups as they progress through the game. The player will be able to attack the enemies throughout the game with a wide array of moves through street fighter inspired motion inputs. This will unlock ways to interact with the world and take on new foes the player will find throughout the game.
